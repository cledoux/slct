SLCT version 0.05 - simple logfile clustering tool


Introduction:

SLCT is a tool that was designed to find clusters in logfile(s), so that
each cluster corresponds to a certain line pattern that occurs frequently
enough. The special cluster of outliers contains lines that do not fit
well to any regular cluster.
